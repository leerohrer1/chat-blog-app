title: "Where to Start"
excerpt: "When I decided to be a person with hobbies, I had no idea where to begin. What helped was starting with things I already felt kind of okay at. I didn’t jump into anything totally new right away. Instead, I picked stuff I’d tried before or felt a little confident about."

When I decided to be a person with hobbies, I had no idea where to begin. What helped was starting with things I already felt kind of okay at. I didn’t jump into anything totally new right away. Instead, I picked stuff I’d tried before or felt a little confident about. For example, Pilates was a big thing when I was in college, and I’d gone to a few classes at our campus gym and done alright, so yoga felt like a safe hobby to try. Having even a small foundation made it less intimidating to be a beginner. As time went on, I felt more comfortable trying things that were more out of my norm, like skateboarding. That definitely came with time and after gaining confidence from improving at other skills.

Once I picked something, I looked for resources like YouTube videos, online forums, or people I knew who were into the same thing and who I could ask for help. Talking to others was a little uncomfortable at first because it made the whole thing real. They might ask how it was going, and then I’d feel like I had to follow through. If you’re not ready for that kind of pressure, the internet is a solid place to start.

Next, I made a schedule. I committed to at least 15 minutes, three times a week, for at least three months. For some things, like drawing, I made myself do it every day. For yoga, I did an hour three times a week. The key was consistent, regular practice.

Sometimes I’d ask for feedback. Reddit is great if you’re not quite ready to share your hobby with people you know. But if you have a friend you trust not to laugh in your face, they can be a great source of support, especially if they’re into the same hobby.

Eventually, I learned that being bad at something is part of the process. There are good days and bad days, but the only thing that really matters is time in the dojo. With any new skill I have learned that embarrassment is the cost of entry. You can’t be good at something without being bad at it first.
